# bindingMOAD
To curate the protein-ligand binding affinity data in MOAD, I developed Java code (by defining my own classes) capable of comparing MOAD to these alternative databases. For each inconsistent entry, my code identified the type of mismatch and sorted them by their PDBID (the fours character protein ID).
